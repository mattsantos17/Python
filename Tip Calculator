# Below i have created a tip calculator using python: 

print('Welcome to your one and only tip calculator! ')
str_total_bill = input('How much was the total Bill? $')
str_tip = input('How much tip do you want to leave? "(Enter percentage amount as a whole number)" ')
bill = float(str_total_bill)
tip = int(str_tip) / 100 
tip_amount = bill*tip
str_people = input('How many people are paying? ')
people = int(str_people)
total_amount = tip_amount+bill
amount_per = round(total_amount / people,2)
print(f'Each person must pay {amount_per}' )
